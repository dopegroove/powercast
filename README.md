Powercast (A powershell podcast download manager)
=========

I am making this podcast downloader because I found other bigger projects like Miro and gpodder would choke and 
die on my OPML feed all the time. This script will do the following when it's all completed. 
This script should be run on Powershell 3 or greater.


- download the latest podcasts from the OPML you point it at 
- run various options via command line (To Do)
- delete podcasts older then certain date. (To Do)
- Add and Remove Links from your OPML. (To Do)
- notify of new podcasts that have been downloaded via Prowl. (Maybe)

if you have any other ideas or want to contribute, Please let me know.
