A Powershell podcast download manager.

I am making this podcast downloader because I found other bigger projects like Miro and gpodder would choke and 
die on my OPML feed all the time. This script will do the following when it's all completed.

- download the latest podcasts from the OPML to point it at (To Do)
- delete podcasts older then certain date. (To Do)
- Add and Remove Links from your OPML. (To Do)
- notify of new podcasts that have been downloaded via Prowl. (Maybe)

if you have any other ideas or want to contribute, Please let me know.
